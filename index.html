        Here’s a little PINCH...about me I’m just a lil’ lady residing in the
        city of Brotherly Love--that’d be Philadelphia, PA. Growing up I was a
        shy little shrimp to the outside world but at home I was singing into my
        jumbo size Crayola crayon, that was obviously my microphone, along side
        my mom’s VHS tape of Madonna’s Like A Virgin Tour for all you 80’s
        babies out there. My dad always had his camcorder running so I’ve got
        the evidence if you need more visual proof. I’d say performing was deep
        in there at an early age for sure. I also convinced my grandmother that
        Chris Columbus should consider making another Home Alone movie and cast
        me as Macaulay Culkin’s love interest--I didn’t have any feelings for
        Mr. Culkin I just thought I could act in a movie. By the time I finished
        high school I was a full throttle ballerina and budding thespian. I
        loved to dance but I knew it wasn’t something I took seriously enough to
        pursue professionally. I still love to boogie and dancing will always be
        one of my favorite things to do. It was the performance aspect that
        hooked me.

        MOVING ON! Then college happened and if I’m being honest it didn’t suit
        me. I studied theatre and it seemed too curricular, too memorize all
        this information over load to spit it back out to only forget it years
        later at trivia night at the local bar. Don't get me wrong, I have full
        respect for Mr. Shakespeare and the history of theatre and performance
        but I was itching to be on my feet moving and exploring what boundaries
        theatre could push through. So in my haste to graduate I was introduced
        to The Pig Iron Theatre Company’s show “Mission to Mercury” and was
        blown away by what I saw. I never saw a performance like this and
        thought, “ I wanna make that kind of theatre.” After college was filled
        with acting classes, auditioning, working in the service industry as a
        waitress and bartender, to more acting classes, [ click on that resume
        link to see all that training woof! ] and to joining a traveling improv
        group. But still after all those amazing experiences I still felt lost.
        I was confused about what kind of actor I was.

      <p class="content__text">
        ONWARD! After a few years of trying to pay my dues as a struggling
        artist my beloved Pig Iron Theatre Co. started a two year advanced
        training program rooted in Lecoq pedagogy and exploring the creation of
        theatre as an ensemble. My fourteen peers and I were trained movement,
        mask, character work ( gee whiz I love wearing wigs ) mime,cabaret, and
        clown. Yea....clown. And for anyone who’s got a bad case of
        coulrophobia--fear of clowns please skip to the end! I currently work
        with a non-profit called Healthy Humor Inc. as a healthcare clown at
        Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I try my hardest to make the kiddos
        in that hospital smile. It’s one of the most rewarding jobs I’ve ever
        been able to do.

        LET’S WRAP THIS UP! Prey tell, what about voice over you ask? Well, in
        my search to figure what kind of actor I am I always had this little
        peep in the back of my head that told me, “ You’d really enjoy being a
        voice over actor for animation...just saying.” That peep turned into a
        yell as soon as I took my first voice over class. I stepped into that
        recording booth and that chubby cheeked cherub hit me in my soft spot
        and then I knew it. I felt home, like I belonged in that booth. Alas,
        this is the kind of actor I am! So I worked hard to educate and immerse
        myself in the voice over world and I must say I love it. Don’t get me
        wrong- I still enjoy performing on stage and working on films but
        there’s just something about voice over that just rocks my world.

        So let’s do this! If you like what you hear and you wanna chitty chat
        send me an email, ring me up, or we can Skype over coffee-- whichever
        you prefer! I’d love to work with you.
