                Here’s a little <span class="italic">PINCH</span> about me:
                I’m just a lil’ lady residing in the city of otherly
                Love--that’d be Philadelphia, PA. Growing up I was a shy little
                shrimp to the outside world but at home I was singing into my
                jumbo size Crayola crayon, that was obviously my microphone,
                along side my mom’s VHS tape of Madonna’s
                <span class="italic">Like a Virgin</span> Tour for all you 80’s
                babies out there. My dad always had his camcorder running so
                I’ve got the evidence if you need more visual proof. I’d say
                performing was deep in there at an early age for sure. I also
                convinced my grandmother that Chris Columbus should consider
                making another Home Alone movie and cast me as Macaulay Culkin’s
                love interest--I didn’t have any feelings for Mr. Culkin I just
                thought I could act in a movie. By the time I finished high
                school I was a full-throttle ballerina and budding thespian. I
                loved to dance but I knew it wasn’t something I took seriously
                enough to pursue professionally. I still love to boogie and
                dancing will always be one of my favorite things to do. It was,
                however, the performance aspect that hooked me.

                MOVING ON! Then college happened and if I’m being honest it
                didn’t suit me. I studied theatre and it seemed too curricular,
                too memorize all this information over load to spit it back out
                to only forget it years later at trivia night at the local bar.
                Don't get me wrong, I have full respect for Mr. Shakespeare and
                the history of theatre and performance but I was itching to be
                on my feet moving and exploring what boundaries theatre could
                push through. So in my haste to graduate I was introduced to The
                Pig Iron Theatre Company’s show “Mission to Mercury” and was
                blown away by what I saw. I never saw a performance like this
                and thought, “ I wanna make that kind of theatre.” After college
                was filled with acting classes, auditioning, working in the
                service industry as a waitress and bartender, to more acting
                classes, [ click on that resume link to see all that training
                woof! ] and to joining a traveling improv group. But still after
                all those amazing experiences I still felt lost. I was confused
                about what kind of actor I was.

                ONWARD! After a few years of trying to pay my dues as a
                struggling artist my beloved Pig Iron Theatre Co. started a two
                year advanced training program rooted in Lecoq pedagogy and
                exploring the creation of theatre as an ensemble. My fourteen
                peers and I were trained movement, mask, character work ( gee
                whiz I love wearing wigs ) mime,cabaret, and clown.
                Yea....clown. And for anyone who’s got a bad case of
                coulrophobia--fear of clowns please skip to the end! I currently
                work with a non-profit called Healthy Humor Inc. as a healthcare
                clown at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I try my hardest
                to make the kiddos in that hospital smile. It’s one of the most
                rewarding jobs I’ve ever been able to do.

                <span class="bold">LET'S WRAP THIS UP!</span> Prey tell, what
                about voice over you ask? Well, in my search to figure what kind
                of actor I am I always had this little peep in the back of my
                head that told me, “ You’d really enjoy being a voice over actor
                for animation...just saying.” That peep turned into a yell as
                soon as I took my first voice over class. I stepped into that
                recording booth and that chubby cheeked cherub hit me in my soft
                spot and then I knew it. I felt home, like I belonged in that
                booth. Alas, this is the kind of actor I am! So I worked hard to
                educate and immerse myself in the voice over world and I must
                say I love it. Don’t get me wrong- I still enjoy performing on
                stage and working on films but there’s just something about
                voice over that just rocks my world.
