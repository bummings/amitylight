          Here’s a little <span class="italic">PINCH</span>...about me: I’m just
          a lil’ lady residing in the city of otherly Love--that’d be
          Philadelphia, PA. Growing up I was a shy little shrimp to the outside
          world but at home I was singing into my jumbo size Crayola crayon,
          that was obviously my microphone, along side my mom’s VHS tape of
          Madonna’s <span class="italic">Like a Virgin</span> Tour for all you
          80’s babies out there. My dad always had his camcorder running so I’ve
          got the evidence if you need more visual proof. I’d say performing was
          deep in there at an early age for sure. I also convinced my
          grandmother that Chris Columbus should consider making another Home
          Alone movie and cast me as Macaulay Culkin’s love interest--I didn’t
          have any feelings for Mr. Culkin I just thought I could act in a
          movie. By the time I finished high school I was a full-throttle
          ballerina and budding thespian. I loved to dance but I knew it wasn’t
          something I took seriously enough to pursue professionally. I still
          love to boogie and dancing will always be one of my favorite things to
          do. It was, however, the performance aspect that hooked me.

          MOVING ON! Then college happened and if I’m being honest it didn’t
          suit me. I studied theatre and it seemed too curricular, too memorize
          all this information over load to spit it back out to only forget it
          years later at trivia night at the local bar. Don't get me wrong, I
          have full respect for Mr. Shakespeare and the history of theatre and
          performance but I was itching to be on my feet moving and exploring
          what boundaries theatre could push through. So in my haste to graduate
          I was introduced to The Pig Iron Theatre Company’s show “Mission to
          Mercury” and was blown away by what I saw. I never saw a performance
          like this and thought, “ I wanna make that kind of theatre.” After
          college was filled with acting classes, auditioning, working in the
          service industry as a waitress and bartender, to more acting classes,
          [ click on that resume link to see all that training woof! ] and to
          joining a traveling improv group. But still after all those amazing
          experiences I still felt lost. I was confused about what kind of actor
          I was.

          ONWARD! After a few years of trying to pay my dues as a struggling
          artist my beloved Pig Iron Theatre Co. started a two year advanced
          training program rooted in Lecoq pedagogy and exploring the creation
          of theatre as an ensemble. My fourteen peers and I were trained
          movement, mask, character work ( gee whiz I love wearing wigs )
          mime,cabaret, and clown. Yea....clown. And for anyone who’s got a bad
          case of coulrophobia--fear of clowns please skip to the end! I
          currently work with a non-profit called Healthy Humor Inc. as a
          healthcare clown at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I try my
          hardest to make the kiddos in that hospital smile. It’s one of the
          most rewarding jobs I’ve ever been able to do.

          LET’S WRAP THIS UP! Prey tell, what about voice over you ask? Well, in
          my search to figure what kind of actor I am I always had this little
          peep in the back of my head that told me, “ You’d really enjoy being a
          voice over actor for animation...just saying.” That peep turned into a
          yell as soon as I took my first voice over class. I stepped into that
          recording booth and that chubby cheeked cherub hit me in my soft spot
          and then I knew it. I felt home, like I belonged in that booth. Alas,
          this is the kind of actor I am! So I worked hard to educate and
          immerse myself in the voice over world and I must say I love it. Don’t
          get me wrong- I still enjoy performing on stage and working on films
          but there’s just something about voice over that just rocks my world.
