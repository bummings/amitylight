        Here’s a little PINCH...about me I’m just a lil’ lady residing in the
        city of Brotherly Love--that’d be Philadelphia, PA. Growing up I was a
        shy little shrimp to the outside world but at home I was singing into my
        jumbo size Crayola crayon, that was obviously my microphone, along side
        my mom’s VHS tape of Madonna’s Like A Virgin Tour for all you 80’s
        babies out there. My dad always had his camcorder running so I’ve got
        the evidence if you need more visual proof. I’d say performing was deep
        in there at an early age for sure. I also convinced my grandmother that
        Chris Columbus should consider making another Home Alone movie and cast
        me as Macaulay Culkin’s love interest--I didn’t have any feelings for
        Mr. Culkin I just thought I could act in a movie. By the time I finished
        high school I was a full throttle ballerina and budding thespian. I
        loved to dance but I knew it wasn’t something I took seriously enough to
        pursue professionally. I still love to boogie and dancing will always be
        one of my favorite things to do. It was the performance aspect that
        hooked me. MOVING ON! Then college happened and if I’m being honest it
        didn’t suit me. I studied theatre and it seemed too curricular, too
        memorize all this information over load to spit it back out to only
        forget it years later at trivia night at the local bar. Don't get me
        wrong, I have full respect for Mr. Shakespeare and the history of
        theatre and performance but I was itching to be on my feet moving and
        exploring what boundaries theatre could push through. So in my haste to
        graduate I was introduced to The Pig Iron Theatre Company’s show
        “Mission to Mercury” and was blown away by what I saw. I never saw a
        performance like this and thought, “ I wanna make that kind of theatre.”
        After college was filled with acting classes, auditioning, working in
        the service industry as a waitress and bartender, to more acting
        classes, [ click on that resume link to see all that training woof! ]
        and to joining a traveling improv group. But still after all those
        amazing experiences I still felt lost. I was confused about what kind of
        actor I was. ONWARD! After a few years of trying to pay my dues as a
        struggling artist my beloved Pig Iron Theatre Co. started a two year
        advanced training program rooted in Lecoq pedagogy and exploring the
        creation of theatre as an ensemble. My fourteen peers and I were trained
        movement, mask, character work ( gee whiz I love wearing wigs ) mime,
        cabaret, and clown. Yea....clown. And for anyone who’s got a bad case of
        coulrophobia--fear of clowns please skip to the end! I currently work
        with a non-profit called Healthy Humor Inc. as a healthcare clown at
        Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I try my hardest to make the kiddos
        in that hospital smile. It’s one of the most rewarding jobs I’ve ever
        been able to do. LET’S WRAP THIS UP! Prey tell, what about voice over
        you ask? Well, in my search to figure what kind of actor I am I always
        had this little peep in the back of my head that told me, “ You’d really
        enjoy being a voice over actor for animation...just saying.” That peep
        turned into a yell as soon as I took my first voice over class. I
        stepped into that recording booth and that chubby cheeked cherub hit me
        in my soft spot and then I knew it. I felt home, like I belonged in that
        booth. Alas, this is the kind of actor I am! So I worked hard to educate
        and immerse myself in the voice over world and I must say I love it.
        Don’t get me wrong I still enjoy performing on stage and working on
        films but there’s just something about voice over that just rocks my
        world. So let’s do this! If you like what you hear and you wanna chitty
        chat send me an email, ring me up, or we can Skype over
        coffee--whichever you prefer! I’d love to work with you.
